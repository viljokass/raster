##This file states the sources of the models in this folder.
Files might contain slight modifications.
IDK if this needs to be here but here we go anyways.

gourd.obj and dodecahedron.obj are from
https://github.com/angerangel/LCR3D/blob/master/3D-models/

icosahedron.obj is an export from Wings3D modeling software

pyramid.obj was made by me using Vim, paper and a ballpoint pen
