# raster
A little rasterizer program using knowledge from ssloy's tinyrenderer series and other sources.

Uses GTK3 and glm.

Still needs at least (a proper) z-buffer implementation (current one breaks apart if there's intersecting triangles) and whatever other things I decide to add in.
Texture mapping, maybe
